                <p>I am a Web Developer with a passion for learning new skills and problem solving. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Denver Women's Coding Bootcamp, and am looking forward to bringing fresh programming knowledge to a professional position.</p>
                <p>In addition to knowledge of website display languages like CSS, Bootstrap, and Materialize, I am particually skilled at JavaScript, jQuery, and Node.js. I have applied that knowledge to building user-friendly applications that function well behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>I also am developing skills in mySQL, Sequelize, Firebase, Heroku, and MongoDB. I would like to apply my well-rounded skill set to building full-stack web applications from the ground up.</p>
